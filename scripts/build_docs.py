EXEC_SUMMARY = """
This document consolidates **all** ChartNav backend phases delivered to
date.

**Phase 1 — Workflow spine.** Alembic migration `a1b2c3d4e5f6` introduced `encounters` and `workflow_events` tables with FKs and indexes. Six encounter endpoints. Idempotent seed.

**Phase 2 — State machine + filtering.** `POST /encounters/{id}/status` enforces explicit forward + rework edges. `GET /encounters` accepts `organization_id`, `location_id`, `status`, `provider_name` filters.

**Phase 3 — Dev auth + org scoping.** `apps/api/app/auth.py` resolves the caller from `X-User-Email`. Every encounter route became org-scoped: cross-org reads return 404, cross-org body/query assertions 403.

**Phase 4 — RBAC + full scoping + tests.** `apps/api/app/authz.py` introduces `admin` / `clinician` / `reviewer` roles and per-edge transition rules. `/organizations`, `/locations`, `/users` are now authenticated and scoped. `{error_code, reason}` envelope is standardized. 25-test pytest suite covers auth, scoping, RBAC, state-machine invariants.

**Phase 5 — CI + runtime hardening.** GitHub Actions workflow runs install + Alembic upgrade on an isolated CI DB + idempotent seed + pytest + live smoke. A separate `docs` job regenerates the final HTML/PDF. Root `Makefile`, `apps/api/scripts/smoke.sh`, and `scripts/build_docs.py` codify the local verification + doc-build paths.

**Phase 6 — Production seam + deploy target + Postgres parity.** DB layer moved to SQLAlchemy Core. `apps/api/app/config.py` centralizes env. `auth.py` gained a bearer stub that returns 501 honestly. Dockerfile hardened, `docker-compose.prod.yml` + `scripts/pg_verify.sh` + `backend-postgres` CI job land.

**Phase 7 — Frontend workflow UI.** Typed API client + identity seam + full two-pane workflow console (list + filters + detail + timeline + role-aware actions). Error banners surface the backend envelope verbatim.

**Phase 8 — Create UI + frontend tests + frontend CI.** Admin/clinician can create encounters through a modal; Vitest + Testing Library harness (12 tests) locks the UI down; dedicated `frontend` CI job runs typecheck + tests + build on every push/PR.

**Phase 9 — Playwright E2E + release pipeline.** Playwright boots backend + frontend together, 8 Chromium scenarios, new `e2e` CI job. `release.yml` workflow on `v*.*.*` tags: GHCR push + release bundle + GitHub Release with tarballs and MANIFEST.

**Phase 10 — Real JWT bearer auth + operational hardening.** Real PyJWT validation against a JWKS URL (signature + iss + aud + exp + claim mapping). Request correlation (`X-Request-ID`), structured JSON logs, `security_audit_events` table (`b2c3d4e5f6a7`), CORS driven by config, per-process rate limiter.

**Phase 11 — Staging deployment + observability.** New `/ready` + `/metrics` surfaces. Pinned-image staging compose + runbook scripts + release-bundled staging tarball. `deploy-config` CI job validates compose + shellcheck.

**Phase 12 — Admin governance + event discipline + pagination.** DB CHECK on `users.role`, `is_active` soft-delete flags, admin CRUD for users + locations, `EVENT_SCHEMAS` allowlist, encounter pagination via `limit`/`offset` + `X-Total-Count`. `AdminPanel` modal with Users + Locations tabs.

**Phase 13 — Operator control plane.** `GET/PATCH /organization` + `GET /security-audit-events` + admin panel Organization & Audit tabs. `invited_at` stamping on admin create.

**Phase 14 — Invitations, settings schema, audit export, event hardening, bulk users.** Migration `e5f6a7b8c9d0` adds `invitation_token_hash` (sha256-only), `invitation_expires_at`, `invitation_accepted_at`. New endpoints: `POST /users/{id}/invite`, `POST /invites/accept`, `POST /users/bulk`, `GET /security-audit-events/export`. Organization settings becomes a typed `OrganizationSettings` pydantic model (extra=forbid) with dedicated fields + an `extensions` forward-compat bucket. Event payloads enforce per-type value discipline (status enums, non-empty strings, non-negative ints). Admin UI adds per-user **Invite** with a one-shot raw-token banner, a **Bulk import…** dialog, an **Export CSV** button on the audit tab, typed inputs on the Organization tab, and a minimal `/invite?invite=<token>` accept screen. Suites grow to **110 pytest / 25 Vitest / 12 Playwright**.

**Phase 15 — Enterprise quality + compliance.** Five real enterprise-credibility guarantees land together. (1) **Accessibility baseline**: `@axe-core/playwright` over Chromium, 5 scans covering app shell + encounter list/detail + admin users/audit + invite accept; `serious`/`critical` findings are blocking; established fixes land `aria-label` on the event-type and inline role `<select>`s. (2) **Visual regression baseline**: 4 Playwright screenshots (encounter list, admin users, admin audit, invite accept) at 1280×820 with animations disabled and `maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.02`; macOS baselines committed for local dev; CI intentionally skips because Chromium renders differently on Linux (documented gap). (3) **Admin list scaling**: `GET /users` and `GET /locations` gain `limit`, `offset`, `q`, and (users) `role` query params with `X-Total-Count`/`X-Limit`/`X-Offset` headers; UI adds search + Prev/Next pager (25/page) on both tabs. (4) **Feature-flag consumption**: `organization.settings.feature_flags.audit_export` and `.bulk_import` now actually hide the **Export CSV** / **Bulk import…** buttons; defaults stay `true`; documented as a UX toggle, not a security control. (5) **Release compliance signals**: `scripts/sbom.py` captures project + git sha/tag/dirty + image tag + `pip list` + `npm list`; `scripts/release_build.sh` also emits `chartnav-api-<v>.digest.txt` via `docker image inspect`; both are attached to GitHub Releases and included in `MANIFEST.txt`. (6) **Audit retention scaffolding**: `apps/api/app/retention.py::prune_audit_events` + `scripts/audit_retention.py` CLI + `CHARTNAV_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` env (default `0` = never); the app never silently prunes. Suites grow to **118 pytest / 28 Vitest / 21 Playwright** (12 workflow + 5 a11y + 4 visual-local).

**Phase 16 — Platform mode & interoperability.** ChartNav is now explicitly two products in one — a standalone lightweight EMR/EHR **and** an integration-first overlay on top of an existing EHR/EMR. The shape is architectural, not a feature flag bolted on. Four real changes landed together: (1) **Operating modes**: `CHARTNAV_PLATFORM_MODE` ∈ {`standalone`, `integrated_readthrough`, `integrated_writethrough`}, validated at import time; `standalone` pins the adapter to `native`, `integrated_*` defaults to `stub`. (2) **Adapter boundary** — `app/integrations/base.py::ClinicalSystemAdapter` protocol (`fetch_patient`, `search_patients`, `fetch_encounter`, `update_encounter_status`, `write_note`, `sync_reference_data`, `info`), `AdapterError` / `AdapterNotSupported`, `SourceOfTruth` enum. Ships two honest implementations: `NativeChartNavAdapter` (persists to the ChartNav DB via the same SA Core surface the HTTP routes use, refuses patient ops until a native `patients` table lands), and `StubClinicalSystemAdapter` (canned reads, write-through records writes to an in-process list, read-through raises `AdapterNotSupported`). Vendor adapters plug into a mutable `_VENDOR_ADAPTERS` registry via `register_vendor_adapter(key, factory)` — no decorator magic, grep-able. (3) **HTTP surface** — `GET /platform` (any authenticated caller) returns mode + adapter key + display name + supports-* flags + source-of-truth map. No secret leakage (asserted). (4) **Frontend awareness** — `api.ts` gains `getPlatform` + types; `AdminPanel` fetches `/platform` on mount and renders a platform banner above the tabs on every admin view. CI fallout from phase 15 was repaired in the same commit window: migration `c3d4e5f6a7b8` switched from `sa.text("1")` (Postgres-incompatible BOOLEAN default) to `sa.text("true")`, and vitest was downgraded to `^3.2.4` + lockfile regenerated to fix `npm ci` on Linux/Node 20 (Vitest 4 had transitively pulled rolldown + Vite 8 + esbuild 0.28, leaving the lockfile incomplete for non-mac platforms). Suites grow to **131 pytest** / **30 Vitest** / 21 Playwright. `GET /platform` is the only new endpoint.

**Phase 17 — Brand & domain alignment.** Two cuts. (1) **Domain**: `chartnav.ai` and `www.chartnav.ai` → `https://arcgsystems.com/chartnav/` via GoDaddy 301 forwarding (primary, executed in the GoDaddy UI per `arcg-live/docs/chartnav-ai-domain-runbook.md`) plus an in-repo host-based safety-net in `arcg-live/index.html` + `public/404.html` that redirects the visitor before React mounts. The `CNAME` stays `arcgsystems.com` — Pages' primary domain is preserved. (2) **Brand-aligned product UI**: `apps/web/src/styles.css` now consumes the ChartNav marketing site's token set directly (`--cn-*`). Teal `#0B6E79` primary with hover/active/tint/soft scale, Inter typography (cv02/03/04/11 features), tightened shadow scale, AA-safe muted text (`#475569`), pill admin tabs, brand-teal focus rings. The app header renders `public/brand/chartnav-logo.svg` (the real wordmark with the pulse-cross mark, copied from `arcg-live/public/chartnav/brand/`), and the app shell gains a footer with a single subtle **Powered by ARCG Systems** attribution (11px uppercase, 0.12em letter-spacing, `data-testid="app-footer-arcg"`, Vitest-asserted copy). Legacy token names stayed as aliases so zero component code needed to change. Visual baselines regenerated (`visual.spec.ts-snapshots/*-darwin.png`); axe-AA 5/5 still green. Suites: 131 pytest, **31 Vitest** (+1 footer), 17 Playwright workflow+a11y, 4 visual. No endpoints changed.

**Phase 18 — Native clinical layer + FHIR adapter.** ChartNav's dual-mode architecture becomes real. (1) **Native clinical ownership** — Alembic migration `f6a7b8c9d0e1` adds `patients` (org-scoped, `patient_identifier` unique per org, `external_ref` for integration mirroring, DOB + sex-at-birth, `is_active`) and `providers` (org-scoped, `display_name`, 10-digit `npi` unique per org when non-null, `specialty`, `external_ref`, `is_active`). Two nullable FKs land on `encounters` (`patient_id`, `provider_id`); legacy text fields stay for display continuity. Seed populates real rows and backfills FKs on re-seed without duplicating. (2) **New HTTP surface** — `GET/POST /patients` (admin + clinician write) and `GET/POST /providers` (admin-only write) with pagination + search + `X-Total-Count` headers. Mode-gated: `integrated_readthrough` returns 409 `native_write_disabled_in_integrated_mode` on both POSTs so the UI renders a clear banner instead of silently succeeding. (3) **First real external adapter** — `FHIRAdapter` in `app/integrations/fhir.py` implements the `ClinicalSystemAdapter` protocol against generic FHIR R4. Handles `fetch_patient`, `search_patients`, `fetch_encounter` with normalization (MRN extraction, participant display, `Encounter.status` → ChartNav status mapping). Writes raise `AdapterNotSupported` honestly. Pluggable transport (fixture injection for tests; urllib by default — zero new runtime deps). Config: `CHARTNAV_FHIR_BASE_URL`, `CHARTNAV_FHIR_AUTH_TYPE`, `CHARTNAV_FHIR_BEARER_TOKEN` with import-time validation. Registered at `fhir` in the vendor registry. (4) **Native adapter honesty** — `NativeChartNavAdapter` now implements `fetch_patient` + `search_patients`; `supports_patient_read`/`supports_patient_write` flip to True; source-of-truth map updated. (5) **Frontend** — `api.ts` gains `Patient`/`Provider` types + CRUD functions; `AdminPanel` adds Patients + Providers tabs with mode-aware banners + form gating. Suites: **155 pytest** (+24), **34 Vitest** (+3), 17 Playwright + 4 visual (baselines refreshed).

**Phase 19 — Transcript → findings → note draft → provider signoff.** The ChartNav wedge becomes real: ingest encounter input, extract structured ophthalmology facts, generate a draft, walk the provider through review/edit/sign/export. Alembic migration `a7b8c9d0e1f2` adds three org-scoped tables: `encounter_inputs` (audio upload metadata, pasted text, manual entry, imported transcript — input_type + processing_status + transcript_text + confidence_summary + source_metadata JSON), `extracted_findings` (CC, HPI, VA OD/OS, IOP OD/OS, extraction_confidence top-level + structured_json for diagnoses/medications/imaging/plan/follow-up), and `note_versions` (monotonic version_number per encounter, status machine `draft → provider_review → revised → signed → exported`, `generated_by` {system|manual}, missing_data_flags JSON array, signed_at + signed_by_user_id, exported_at). The **trust model is enforced at both the data layer and the UI**: three separate tables → three visually distinct tiers in `apps/web/src/NoteWorkspace.tsx` (transcript → extracted facts → AI draft → provider signed). Nine new endpoints (`POST/GET /encounters/{id}/inputs`, `POST /encounters/{id}/notes/generate`, `GET /encounters/{id}/notes`, `GET/PATCH /note-versions/{id}`, `POST /note-versions/{id}/submit-for-review`, `.../sign`, `.../export`); provider edit auto-flips to `revised` + `generated_by=manual`; signed/exported notes are immutable (`note_immutable` 409); reviewers cannot sign (`role_cannot_sign` 403); audit events recorded on every meaningful action. A dedicated service seam at `app/services/note_generator.py` is the **one place** a real LLM plugs in — today's body is a deterministic regex extractor + SOAP template that never fabricates values the transcript doesn't contain, emitting explicit missing-data flags instead. Export is a separate state (download `.txt` + clipboard copy), honest about not writing back to vendor EHRs. Suites grow to **174 pytest** (+19), **42 Vitest** (+8), 17 Playwright workflow+a11y + 4 visual (baselines refreshed for the new workspace). Zero new runtime deps.

**Phase 20 — Adapter-driven encounters + integrated write gating.** The `/encounters` and `/encounters/{id}` HTTP handlers now dispatch through `resolve_adapter()` in every mode. Standalone → native adapter (same SQL); integrated → stub / FHIR / vendor adapter. The `ClinicalSystemAdapter` protocol grew a `list_encounters(organization_id, location_id, status, provider_name, limit, offset) → EncounterListResult` method; `fetch_encounter` was widened to return the full ChartNav row shape. Every encounter row carries `_source` (`chartnav` / `fhir` / `stub` / vendor key) and `_external_ref` where applicable. The FHIR adapter implements `list_encounters` via `GET /Encounter?_count=…&status=<mapped>` with full ChartNav→FHIR status translation (`planned ↔ scheduled`, `in-progress ↔ in_progress`, `finished ↔ completed`). Write gating is mode-aware: `POST /encounters` returns 409 `encounter_write_unsupported` in both integrated modes; `POST /encounters/{id}/status` returns 409 in read-through and **adapter-dispatches** in write-through (generic FHIR still raises `AdapterNotSupported` → 501 `adapter_write_not_supported`, which is a transport-honest distinction from the 409 "mode blocks this entirely"). ChartNav-native tables (`workflow_events`, `encounter_inputs`, `extracted_findings`, `note_versions`, `security_audit_events`) remain fully writable in every mode because they're ChartNav's own tracking. Frontend surfaces the SoT explicitly: encounter detail renders a **source chip** (teal for native, info-blue for external) and, when the encounter is external, a banner explaining the external EHR owns the row + suppressed transitions + suppressed `NoteWorkspace` with an honest subtle-note. `Encounter.id` widens to `number | string` so FHIR vendor ids round-trip cleanly through `getEncounter`/`updateEncounterStatus`/`createEncounterEvent`. Suites: **185 pytest** (+11 `test_integrated_encounters.py`), **44 Vitest** (+2 SoT UI), 17 Playwright + 4 visual (baselines refreshed). Zero new runtime deps; Alembic history unchanged.

**Phase 21 — External encounter → native workflow bridge.** The ChartNav wedge (transcript → findings → note draft → provider signoff) now runs on externally-sourced encounters. Alembic migration `b8c9d0e1f203` adds `encounters.external_ref` + `encounters.external_source` (nullable) plus a UNIQUE `(organization_id, external_ref, external_source)` — the DB-level guarantee that makes the bridge idempotent. New `apps/api/app/services/bridge.py::resolve_or_create_bridged_encounter(...)` is the single service seam: idempotent get-or-create, returns the native row with a `_bridged: true|false` tag so the frontend can differentiate first-create from subsequent resolves. New `POST /encounters/bridge` HTTP endpoint (admin + clinician; reviewer 403; standalone 409 `bridge_not_available_in_standalone_mode`) calls the service, emits a `encounter_bridged` audit event on first create only. Phase-20 contract preserved: bridging does NOT reopen encounter state writes — `POST /encounters/{id}/status` on a bridged row in integrated_readthrough still returns 409 `encounter_write_unsupported`. Frontend `ExternalEncounterBanner` component adds a **Bridge to ChartNav** button inside the SoT banner; clicking dispatches `bridgeEncounter(...)` and navigates to the native id, at which point the full `NoteWorkspace` appears because `_source` is now `chartnav`. Reviewer role sees the banner but no button, with a subtle-note explanation. The external-note copy was rewritten to describe the bridge path instead of a generic native-only limitation. Suites grow to **196 pytest** (+11 `test_encounter_bridge.py`), **45 Vitest** (+1), 17 Playwright + 4 visual (baselines refreshed). Zero new runtime deps.

**Phase 22 — Async ingestion + orchestration lifecycle.** The transcript-to-note wedge now runs on a real async-job state machine instead of flipping rows straight to `completed` on arrival. Alembic migration `c9d0e1f2a304` adds six columns to `encounter_inputs` (`retry_count`, `last_error`, `last_error_code`, `started_at`, `finished_at`, `worker_id`). New `app/services/ingestion.py` owns the `queued → processing → completed | failed | needs_review` state machine, persists every transition as a single DB write, and exposes a `set_transcriber(fn)` seam for real audio STT (default is an honest `NotImplementedError`-shape stub). New `app/services/note_orchestrator.py` wraps the phase-19 `note_generator` so the HTTP handler never touches the generator directly — a real LLM drops into one function, the pipeline contract (input ready → findings extracted → note drafted → provider review required) is enforced. Two new endpoints ship: `POST /encounter-inputs/{id}/process` drives a queued row through the pipeline and returns `{input, ingestion_error}`; `POST /encounter-inputs/{id}/retry` flips `failed`/`needs_review` rows back to `queued` with `retry_count++` and emits an `encounter_input_retried` audit event. Frontend surfaces the full lifecycle in NoteWorkspace Tier 1: color-coded status pills, a `retries N` chip, an error banner with `last_error_code`+`last_error`, Retry + Process-now buttons, and a Generate-draft button gated on at least one `completed` input. Suites grow to **210 pytest** (+14 `test_ingestion_lifecycle.py`), **49 Vitest** (+4 NoteWorkspace lifecycle), 17 Playwright + 4 visual (baselines refreshed). No new runtime deps; the ingestion service + orchestrator are stdlib-only.

**Phase 23 — Background worker foundation + bridged-encounter refresh (this phase).** The ingestion pipeline gains a real background-worker seam without new infrastructure (no Redis, no Celery, no broker). Alembic migration `d0e1f2a30415` adds `encounter_inputs.claimed_by` + `claimed_at` and an index on `(processing_status, claimed_by)` so the "one unclaimed queued row" query is cheap. New `app/services/worker.py` owns claim-based pickup: atomic claim via conditional UPDATE + read-back confirm (two workers cannot win the same row), `requeue_stale_claims()` recovers `processing` rows whose claim is older than `CHARTNAV_WORKER_CLAIM_TTL_SECONDS` (default 900s, 30s floor), and `run_one()` / `run_until_empty()` drive the existing phase-22 `run_ingestion_now()` with explicit failure-path claim release. Admin HTTP surfaces (`POST /workers/tick` / `/drain` / `/requeue-stale`) make the primitives ops-console-accessible; `scripts/run_worker.py` ships a CLI (`--once` / `--drain` / `--loop` / `--requeue-stale`) with JSON-per-line output. New `app/services/bridge_sync.py` + `POST /encounters/{id}/refresh` re-fetches the external shell via the resolved adapter and reconciles ONLY the mirror fields (`patient_identifier`, `patient_name`, `provider_name`, `status`). Source-of-truth guard: 409 `not_bridged` on standalone-native, 409 `external_source_mismatch` when the active adapter key differs from the historical `external_source`. Emits `encounter_refreshed` audit event; never writes back to the external EHR; never touches ChartNav-native workflow tables. Frontend: NoteWorkspace Tier 1 gains a manual "↻ Refresh" button + a "Processing continues in the background" info banner that differentiates "waiting for a worker" from "currently processing"; encounter detail gains a `BridgedEncounterRefreshBanner` for native rows with `external_ref` (admin + clinician only; reviewer disabled-note). `refreshDetail` in App.tsx preserves the mounted detail pane across re-fetches so banner state doesn't unmount mid-flow. Suites: **231 pytest** (+21 `test_worker.py` + `test_bridge_sync.py`), **55 Vitest** (+6), 17 Playwright + 4 visual (baselines refreshed). Zero new runtime deps; worker is stdlib + SQLAlchemy only.

Preserved untouched: `/health`, `/`, SQLite dev workflow, state machine + filtering surface, workflow_events model, existing endpoint contracts.
